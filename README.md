## Built With

- Ruby
- Rspec

## Description

The task was to implement a [Tic Tac Toe game](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/oop).

This project is mainly about

-  Object Oriented Programming
-  The [DRY rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)

## How to Play the Game
* Clone this github repo onto your local machine
* In the terminal move to the home directory of this repo 
* Type the following commands

  ```
  cd bin 
  ./main
  ```
* Alternatively, you can create an executable script `main` ([Read About How to Create an Executable Script](https://commandercoriander.net/blog/2013/02/16/making-a-ruby-script-executable/)) 
 - In order to play the Tic Tac Toe game just run the executable script in the terminal by typing `main` and follow the prompt
   ```
   main
   ```

## Rules of the Game

- Players' names  can be entered at the beginning of the game
- Players can choose 'X' or 'O' as a symbol
- To win the game, three identical symbols must be next to each other vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. If there is a winner, the winner will be announced as "WINNER"
- If no one has won by the end of ninth turn, the game will be ended as a "DRAW"
